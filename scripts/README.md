# Scripts

## SOTA

Scripts that clean and write out data from [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/about).

## arXiv

Scripts for downloading metadata on papers from arXiv.org.

They use the [arxivapi](https://github.com/skaltman/arxivapi) package (very fragile; I wrote it specifically for this project).

## Microsoft

Scripts for gathering data from Microsoft's [Project Academic Knowledge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/project-academic-knowledge/introduction).
